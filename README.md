# CFD-codes
This repository is to store the code in `Computational Fluid Mechanics` course, 2025 spring.

## HW2 Use FTCS, BTCS and CTCS scheme to solve the heat conduction equation numerically.

## HW3 Use 1st order upwind scheme and 1st order Euler implicit scheme to solve the linear convection equation numerically.
