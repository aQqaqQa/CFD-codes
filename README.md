# Computational-Fluid-Mechanics-codes
This repository is to store the code in `Computational Fluid Mechanics` course, 2025 spring.

## HW2 
Use `FTCS`, `BTCS` and `CTCS` scheme to solve the heat conduction equation numerically.

## HW3 
Use 1st order `upwind` scheme and 1st order `Euler implicit` scheme to solve the linear convection equation numerically.

## HW4
Use `Lax-Wendroff` scheme and `Warming-Beam` scheme to solve the linear convetion equation numerically, and use their combination to create a new scheme without the 3rd dispersion term.

## HW5
Use numerical method to calculate the maximum CFL number with which `Jameson` scheme is stable according to von Neumann's stability condition.
